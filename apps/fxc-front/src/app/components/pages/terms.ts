            hang gliding. The Website provides users with access to various features, including:

          <ul>
            <li>
              Flight planning tools that allow users to enter their desired takeoff location, destination and other
              parameters for a flight;
            </li>
            <li>
              Track log uploader that allows users to upload their igc track logs (a standard format for recording GPS
              data) from their devices or online platforms such as XCSoar or XContest;>
            </li>
            <li>
              Map viewer that shows users' igc track logs on a map and enables them to share their tracks with others;
            </li>
            <li>

              their location publicly.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
          <p>
            flyxc collects two types of data from its users: live tracking location data and recorded track log data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The live tracking location data is used to provide real-time information about the whereabouts of pilots who
            have opted in for this service. The recorded track log data is used to show users' flights on a map and to
            allow them to compare their performance with other pilots.
          </p>
          <p>
            flyxc does not sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with any third parties, except as
            required by law or as necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of flyxc, its employees, users,
            or others. flyxc may also disclose your data if it is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or
            part of its assets.
          </p>

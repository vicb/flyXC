Drag the end/middle points on the route segments to update the route.
Right-click on the map to add a new point at the end of the route.

![tracks](docs/tracks.jpeg)

You can display multiples tracks on the same map.

![tracker](docs/tracker.jpeg)

Add your satellite tracker.

All registered pilot live tracks are automatically added to the map and fixes
persist for 24 hours. Recent fixes are bright green while older fixes turn gray
as time passes.

Note: The updates are pushed to the browser as they are ready. There is no need
to force refresh flyxc by reloading the page - this will never display fresher
data.
